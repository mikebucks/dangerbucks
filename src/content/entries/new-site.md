I've been bed ridden for the past week thanks to my double deviated septum. The carcinogen-rich air of Los Angeles doesn't always snake it's way entirely through my unusually narrow nasal cavities. Sometimes it gets stuck and lingers for a few days, causing me to feel like I've been snorting sand. It sucks.

All that time in bed gave me a chance to rebuild my web site from the ground up. That doesn't suck. I've been fascinated with static site generators of late. At work we use the python-based Grow which I have a love/hate relationship with. I knew for my own site I wanted to use something else that suited my sensibilities a little more closely. I was looking to fill these requirements:
* Built on Node/Express so I would be comfortable with the underlying architecture.
* No complicated build tooling. I'm growing tired of 'gulp grunt browserify webpack'ing every damn thing.
* Markdown support.
* Sensible API design with a mellow learning curve. I can't make a huge time investment to learn the thing.

I found something that checked most the boxes in Metalsmith. I'm liking it so far. It feels like it's working with me. We understand each other.
