I've been bed ridden for the past week thanks to my double deviated septum. The carcinogen-rich air of Los Angeles doesn't always snake it's way entirely through my unusually narrow nasal cavities. Sometimes it gets stuck and lingers for a few days causing me to feel like I've been snorting sand. It sucks.

But all that time in bed gave me a chance to rebuild my web site from the ground up. That doesn't suck. I've been really fascinated with static site generators of late. I knew I wanted to use one and it had to meet these requirements:
* Built on Node/Express so I would be familiar with the architecture.
* No complicated build tooling. I'm growing tired of 'gulp grunt browserify webpack'ing every damn thing.
* Markdown support.
* Sensible API design with a mellow learning curve. I can't make a huge time investment to learn the thing.

I found all this and more in Metalsmith. I'm liking it so far. It feels like it's working with me. We understand each other.
